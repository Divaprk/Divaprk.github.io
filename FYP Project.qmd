I was deployed to a local choolate retail company, where I worked with an employee who worked on creating sales orders and invoices.

My job was to automate the whole process of creating sales orders and invoices, which was done manually by the employee. I used UIPath to automate the process of creating sales orders and invoices.

It was diffucult but it worked in the end.
